# nsd_access

This project is forked from [this project](https://github.com/nblauch/nsd_access) which is a fork from [the original nsd_access project](https://github.com/tknapen/nsd_access). It is updated and maintained to be up-to-date with the latest PEP standards.

This package provides a single class (`NSDAccess`) allowing the user to quickly and easily access the data from the Natural Scenes Dataset.

It provides, in arbitrary volume or surface-based formats:
- one-line access to regions of interest and mapper experiment results
- one-line access to arbitrary trial betas (of any provided type)
- one-line access to all behavioral output for arbitrary trials
- one-line access to all images in the dataset, and
- one-line access to the COCO annotations of all images in the dataset.


For more information on this dataet and the project generating it, see [the NSD project website](http://naturalscenesdataset.org)
